abstract = {This paper extends hierarchical analysis to the case where the participants are allowed to employ fuzzy ratios in place of exact ratios. If a person considers alternative A more important than alternative B, then the ratio used might be approximately 3 to 1, or between 2 to 1, and 4 to 1, or at most 5 to 1. The pairwise comparison of the issues and the criteria in the hierarchy produce fuzzy positive reciprocal matrices. The geometric mean method is employed to calculate the fuzzy weights for each fuzzy matrix, and these are combined in the usual manner to determine the final fuzzy weights for the alternatives. The final fuzzy weights are used to rank the alternatives from highest to lowest. The highest ranking contains all the undominated issues. The procedure easily extends to the situation where many experts are utilized in the ranking process, or to the case of missing data. Two examples are presented showing the final fuzzy weights and the final ranking.},
